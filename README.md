# CS411-Project
This is Team 1: Lindsey, Polina, Celine, Lin. 

We wanted to create an application that utilizes multiple APIs, such as Spotify API and weather API, and is useful for everyday use. Since we are big music fans, we decided to create an app that creates Spotify playlists for us for a trip. All one has to do is log in with their Spotify account and enter their destination. 

We have a video of how the project works. I hope you enjoy it as much as we did working on it. <3
