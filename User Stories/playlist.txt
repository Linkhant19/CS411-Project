user generated Spotify playlist

As a user, once I confirm my mode of transportation to my destination, I will receive a Spotify playlist. 
However, in addition to having a link that redirects me to Spotify, I would like to view the list of songs 
included in the generated playlist. This will allow me the option to add the songs to a playlist that I have 
already created. Furthermore, I would like to have a sneak peek of the recommended songs before clicking on 
the Spotify playlist link. Or if I don't have Spotify, seeing the generated playlist I can input these songs
into a playlist in Apple Music.
